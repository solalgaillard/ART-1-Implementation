# ART-1-Implementation
Artificial Neural Network from Grossberg for pattern recognition

This a python implementation of Grossberg's neural network that can be used for pattern recognition with supervised and unsupervised learning. The "vigilance parameter" is used to define the granularity of the recognition.

This program is called with a list of 26 vectors of size 5.
